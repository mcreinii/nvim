# (Neovim) McNvim - mcreinii

#### Creating a Neovim config takes a lot of time and requires patience.

Why? I'm currently using AstroNvim â€” the feeling of "envy" came.
I'm now on my journey of creating my own little config that satisfies my need.

Install these:
- ripgrep
- pipes.sh (AUR, required for the cool dashboard ;>)
- Neovim (v0.10+)
- Python (For lsp)
- Node (For lsp)

`git clone https://github.com/mcreinii/nvim ~/.config/nvim`

You can also do `~/.config/<config-name>` if you don't want to overwrite your current config.
